# Quantum-Coin-Flip

This project simulates a quantum-based coin flip using Qiskit and the AerSimulator.

## Features
- Uses a Hadamard gate to create a superposition state.
- Simulates multiple quantum coin flips.
- Visualizes the distribution of heads and tails.
- Runs on Qiskit's AerSimulator (local quantum simulator).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ML-RAGUL/Quantum-Coin-Flip.git
   cd Quantum-Coin-Flip
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to simulate quantum coin flips:
```bash
python quantum_coin_flip.py
```

## Dependencies
- Qiskit
- Matplotlib

## Output
- Prints the number of times heads (0) and tails (1) appear.
- Displays a histogram of the results.
